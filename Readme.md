# These packages are to demonstrate how we enable quantum safe cryptographic algorithm in UEFI firmware.

## Feature:
1) QuantumSafePkg

This package is a wrapper for liboqs and provide quantum safe signature and key establishment algorithm.
It is similar to CryptoPkg which is a wrapper for openssl.

## Known limitation:
This package is only the sample code to show the concept.
It does not have a full validation and does not meet the production quality yet.
